# Rick and Morty Toy Project

Feature ideas

- add search by location and populate location list with API call
- progressive web app support to save cards offline
- database support to save cards to remote server -> change current 'save' to just be a 'pin' and then add a new 'save' to save to database
- 'save all' results on current page
- 'unsaved all' results on saved page

TODO

- fix prettier

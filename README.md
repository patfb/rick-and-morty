# Rick and Morty Toy Project

Feature ideas

- add search by location and populate location list with API call
- add page slider to search results and make it responsive to number of pages in results
- progressive web app support to save cards offline
- database support to save cards to remote server -> change current 'save' to just be a 'pin' and then add a new 'save' to save to database

TODO
- fix prettier
